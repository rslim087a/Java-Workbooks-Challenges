## Drawing with Java
-----------------

The user can choose to draw a butterfly, elephant, bear, or snake.

```
System.out.print("\nWhich animal would you like to draw?\n");
System.out.println("Write 1 for butterfly ");
System.out.println("Write 2 for elephant  ");
System.out.println("Write 3 for bear      ");
System.out.println("Write 4 for snake     ");
```

## **Task 1: Pick up the user's choice.**
--------------------------------------

Using `Scanner`, pick up the user's choice.

## **Task 2: Write a function**
----------------------------

- Function name.

```java
/**
 * Function name: draw <-----
 * @param choice: (int)
 *
 * Inside the function:
 *  - Based on the choice, draw:
 *      1. a butterfly
 *      2. elephant
 *      3. bear
 *      4. snake
 */
```

- Parameters.

```java
/**
 * Function name: draw
 * @param choice: (int) <-----
 *
 * Inside the function:
 *  - Based on the choice, draw:
 *      1. a butterfly
 *      2. elephant
 *      3. bear
 *      4. snake
 */
```

- Return value: `void`.

- Inside the function, draw one of the animals based on the user's choice.

```java
/**
 * Function name: draw
 * @param choice: (int)
 *
 * Inside the function:   <---------
 *  - Based on the choice, draw:
 *      1. a butterfly
 *      2. elephant
 *      3. bear
 *      4. snake
 */
```

The drawing of each animal is inside your workbook.
