## Bart's detention.
-----------------

Bart's teacher wants him to write lines on the chalkboard.

He needs to write this paragraph 6 times:

`I will not copy and paste code.`

`I will use Camel Case when writing class names.` 

`I will use lower Camel Case when writing function names.`

`I will use lower Camel Case when writing variables names.`

Bart wrote the paragraph once, but it took him a long time!

```
public class Detention {
 
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //what Bart did so far
        System.out.println("I will not copy and paste code.");
        System.out.println("I will use Camel Case when writing class names.");
        System.out.println("I will use lower Camel Case when writing function names.");
        System.out.println("I will use lower Camel Case when writing variables names.");
    }
 
 
}
```

`>> I will not copy and paste code.`

`>> I will use Camel Case when writing class names. `

`>> I will use lower Camel Case when writing function names. `

`>> I will use lower Camel Case when writing variables names.`

## Task 1 - Write a function
-------------------------

Help Bart write a function that does the task for him. The doc comment will guide you.

```
    /**
      * Function name: printLines
      *
      * Inside the function:
      *   1. prints the four lines
      */
```

A doc comment is embedded inside `/** ... */`. They're best at describing the function name, parameters, and return value.

- The name of the function is `printLines`.

```
    /**
      * Function name: printLines  <--
      *
      * Inside the function:
      *   1. prints the four lines
      */
```

- The comment says nothing about parameters, so you can assume it doesn't take any.

- The comment says nothing about a return value. So, you can assume the function is `void`.

- Inside the function, it prints the four lines.

```
    /**
      * Function name: printLines
      *
      * Inside the function:
      *   1. prints the four lines    <--
      */
```

The doc comment outlines everything you need to make your function.

## Task 2 - Call the function
--------------------------

Once you finish writing it, call the function six times from `main()`.

## Run your code.
--------------


```
   >>I will not copy and paste code.
   >>I will use Camel Case when writing class names.
   >>I will use lower Camel Case when writing function names.
   >>I will use lower Camel Case when writing variables names.

   >>I will not copy and paste code.
   >>I will use Camel Case when writing class names. 
   >>I will use lower Camel Case when writing function names.
   >>I will use lower Camel Case when writing variables names.
   
   >>I will not copy and paste code.
   >>I will use Camel Case when writing class names.
   >>I will use lower Camel Case when writing function names.
   >>I will use lower Camel Case when writing variables names.

   ...
```
