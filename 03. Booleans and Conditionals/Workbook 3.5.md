## Your Work Schedule
------------------

Assume that `day` can be any value between 1 (Monday) and 7 (Sunday). There's also a `boolean` variable: `holiday`.

```java
public class WorkSchedule {

     public static void main﻿(﻿String[] args﻿) {
           int day = 3;
           boolean holiday = true;                ﻿ ﻿
     }
}

```

## Task 1 - Do I have work that day?
---------------------------------

In the event of a holiday, `print`:

> Woohoo, no work

During the weekend (Saturday or Sunday), `print`:

> It's the weekend, no work!

Otherwise, `print`:

> Wake up at 7:00 :(

## Run your code.
--------------

### Test Case 1:
```java
    int day = 3;
    boolean holiday = true;                ﻿ ﻿
```

`>>woohoo, no work!`

### Test Case 2:

```java
    int day = 3;
    boolean holiday = false;                ﻿ ﻿
```

`>>Wake up at 7:00 :(`

### Test Case 3:

```java
    int day = 6;
    boolean holiday = false;                ﻿ ﻿
```
`>>It's the weekend, no work!`

## Visualizing the Runtime

After you solve this workbook, I still recommend watching the video solution on Udemy.

It will show you how to visualize the runtime using Visual Studio Code.
