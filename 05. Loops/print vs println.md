# `print` vs. `println`

Before you continue, you need to understand the difference between `print` and `println`.

 - `println()` prints text and moves to a new line.

```java
System.out.﻿println﻿(﻿" a "﻿)﻿;
System.out.﻿println﻿(﻿" b "﻿)﻿;
System.out.﻿println﻿(﻿" c "﻿)﻿;
```

`>> a`

`>> b`

`>> c`

- `print` prints text but it does not move to a new line. So, ensuing print calls print on the same line.

```java
System.out.﻿print﻿(﻿" a "﻿)﻿;
System.out.﻿print﻿(﻿" b "﻿)﻿;
System.out.﻿print﻿(﻿" c "﻿)﻿;
```

`>> a b c`
