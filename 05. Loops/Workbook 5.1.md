## Megaphone.
----------

In this workbook, you will use your Java Megaphone and print this 10 times:

> If Java was easy, they would call it Python!

## Task 1 - Make a `for` loop.
---------------------------

Make a `for` loop that prints this message 10 times.

```java
>>﻿: If Java was easy, they would call it Python!
>>﻿: If Java was easy, they would call it Python!
>>﻿: If Java was easy, they would call it Python!
>>﻿: If Java was easy, they would call it Python!
>>﻿: If Java was easy, they would call it Python!
>>﻿: If Java was easy, they would call it Python!
>>﻿: If Java was easy, they would call it Python!
>>﻿: If Java was easy, they would call it Python!
>>﻿: If Java was easy, they would call it Python!

```

## Task 2 - Number each line.

It will show you how to visualize the runtime using Visual Studio Code.
