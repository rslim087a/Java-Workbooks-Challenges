Guess the number
----------------

In this workbook, the user has to keep guessing a number until they get it right.

Task 1
------

Store a "secret" number between 1 and 5. Then, prompt the user to enter a guess.

Task 2
------

Set up a loop that keeps the user guessing until they get it right.

In other words, the loop should keep running **while** the guess is different from the secret.

Task 3
------

After they guess the number, print:

> You got it!
