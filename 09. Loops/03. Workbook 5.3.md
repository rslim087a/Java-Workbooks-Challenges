## `println()` vs. `print()`

This workbook will need to employ the `print` function. In summary:

 - `println()` prints text and moves to a new line.

```java
System.out.println(" a ");
System.out.println(" b ");
System.out.println(" c ");
```

`>> a`

`>> b`

`>> c`

- `print` prints text but it does not move to a new line. So, ensuing print calls print on the same line.

```java
System.out.print(" a ");
System.out.print(" b ");
System.out.print(" c ");
```

`>> a b c`

Counting Tool
-------------

Timmy's having trouble counting. Let's build a Java app that will help him out.

## Task 1
------

Ask Timmy what number he'd like to count up to.

Make sure Timmy can enter the value **BESIDE** the question.

## Task 2
------

Count from 0 to that number. If Timmy enters 7, your app should should output: `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7`
