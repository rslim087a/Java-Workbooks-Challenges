# Workbook 5.4

From the `Java Bootcamp Resources`, launch **`Workbook 5.4`**.

## `println()` vs. `print()`

This workbook **may** need to employ the `print` function. In summary:

 - `println()` prints text and moves to a new line.

```java
System.out.println(" a ");
System.out.println(" b ");
System.out.println(" c ");
```

`>> a`

`>> b`

`>> c`

- `print` prints text but it does not move to a new line. So, ensuing print calls print on the same line.

```java
System.out.print(" a ");
System.out.print(" b ");
System.out.print(" c ");
```

`>> a b c`

## 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
-------------------------------

A song as old as time itself.

## Task 1 - Write a function
-------------------------

1\. Function name:

```java
/**
 * Function name -- sing. <------
 * @param i (int)
 *
 *
 * Inside the function:
 *  1. print:
 *    <i> bottles of beer on the wall, <i> bottles of beer!
 *    take one down, pass it around <i-1>, bottles of beer on the wall!
 */
```

2\. Parameters:

```java
/**
 * Function name -- sing.
 * @param i (int)  <-------
 *
 *
 * Inside the function:
 *  1. print:
 *      <i> bottles of beer on the wall, <i> bottles of beer!
 *      take one down, pass it around <i-1>, bottles of beer on the wall!
 */
```

**3**. Return value: `void`.

**4**. Inside the function, add the following logic:

```java
/**
 * Function name -- sing.
 * @param i (int)
 *
 *
 * Inside the function: <--------
 *  1. print:
 *      <i> bottles of beer on the wall, <i> bottles of beer!
 *      take one down, pass it around <i-1>, bottles of beer on the wall!
 */
```
The first line is some number. The second line is one less the number.

> **58** bottles of beer on the wall, **58** bottles of beer.

> take one down, pass it around, **57** bottles of beer on the wall!.

## Task 2 - Write a loop
---------------------

Make a `for` loop that:

-  starts from `i` = 99.

-  finishes at `i` = 1.

-  loops down in steps of 1.

Call the function during each run. Your final output should start from 99 bottles of beer on the wall.

And end at 0 bottles of beers.

If you get this output, fix your condition.
