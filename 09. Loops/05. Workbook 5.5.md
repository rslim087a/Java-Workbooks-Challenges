Counter Tool revisited.
-----------------------

Your app should let the user choose:

-  the steps to count by.

-  a number to count from.

-  a number to count until.

Your program will count from the second number to the third number, in steps of the first.

## Task 1 - Get integers from the user.
------------------------------------

You'll ask the user three questions:

1\. Pick a number to count by: `<number>`

2\. Pick a number to start counting from: `<number>`

3\. Pick a number to count to: `<number>`

The user will submit his answer **BESIDE** each question:

## Task 2 - Write a loop
---------------------

Make a `for` loop that:

-  starts from the second number.

-  stops at the third number.

-  counts in steps of the first.

Then, print your count in **ONE** line.
