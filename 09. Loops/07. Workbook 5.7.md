Fizz Buzz
---------

Your program has to print numbers from 0 to 18.

-   If a number is a multiple of three, mark it: Fizz.

-   If a number is a multiple of five, mark it: Buzz.

-   If a number is a multiple of three and five, mark it: FizzBuzz.

## Task 1
------

Make a `for` loop that counts from 0 to 18 and print each number.

```
>>: 0
>>: 1
>>: ...
>>: 18
```

## Task 2
------

Set up an `if - else if - else` statement.

-   if the number is a multiple of three, mark it: `Fizz`.

-   if the number is a multiple of five, mark it: `Buzz`.

-   if the number is a multiple of three and five, mark it: `FizzBuzz`.

**Hints:**
----------

-   A number is a multiple of X if `number` ÷ `X` results in a remainder of zero.

-   There are three conditions for Fizz, Buzz, and FizzBuzz. **Be careful about their order**. If something is FizzBuzz, it also satisfies the conditions for Fizz and Buzz.
