Exams (Revisited)
----------------

Another wave of students needs to write their exams.

## Task 1

Create a new array of five students.

```java
"Malfoy", "Crabbe", "Goyle", "Pansy", "Dean"
```
## Task 2
------

Create a `for` loop that runs through the array, and prints a message for each element.

### Result
```
>>: It's time to take your 5th year exams. Please, take your seats.
>>:
>>: Malfoy, you will take seat 0
>>: Crabbe, you will take seat 1
>>: Goyle, you will take seat 2
>>: Pansy, you will take seat 3
>>: Dean, you will take seat 4
```

## Visualizing the Runtime

After you solve this workbook, I still recommend watching the video solution on Udemy.

It will show you how to visualize the runtime using Visual Studio Code.
