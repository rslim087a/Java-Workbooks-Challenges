## Task 1

The `details()` method contains many loose integers.
```java
"\nCourt length (feet): " + 94 + 
"\nRim height (feet): " + 10 + 
"\nDistance from three-point arc: " + 23 + 
"\nPoints awarded beyond the three-point arc: " + 3 +
"\nPoints awarded inside the three-point arc: " + 2 +
"\nPoints awarded from a free throw: " + 1 + 
"\nLength of each quarter (minutes): " + 12 +
"\nSeconds to attempt shot after gaining possession: " + 24;
```
Create eight constants inside `Regulation` and use them inside the `Game` class.
```java
public class Regulation {

    COURT_LENGTH
    RIM_HEIGHT
    THREE_POINT_DISTANCE
    BEYOND_THREE_POINT_ARC
    INSIDE_THREE_POINT_ARC 
    FREE_THROW
    QUARTER_LENGTH
    POSSESSION_TIME 

}
```
