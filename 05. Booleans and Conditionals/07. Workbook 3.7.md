## The Royal Bank of Java
----------------------

In this workbook, you work for the Royal Bank of Java. Your job is to approve customers for a loan if they:

-   Have **at least** $10,000 in their savings account.

-   Have **less than** $5,000 in credit card debt.

-   Have worked for **more than** 2 years.

The user will also need to provide their name.

Your task is to scan for values and use `if-else` to control how these statements print.

```java
public class Bank {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("\n****ROYAL BANK OF JAVA****");
        System.out.println("Are you here to get a mortgage? (yes or no)");
        System.out.println("\nGreat! In one line" +
                 "\nHow much money do you have in your savings?" +
                 "\nAnd, how much do you owe in credit card debt?");
        System.out.println("\nHow many years have you worked for?");
        System.out.println("What is your name?");
        System.out.println("Congratulations <name>, you have been approved!");
        System.out.println("Sorry, you are not eligible for a mortgage");
        System.out.println("\nOK. Have a nice day!");
        scan.close();
    }
}
```

## Task 1 - Pick up the user's decision

The code starts by asking the user if they're here to get a mortgage. Use `Scanner` to pick up their decision.

```java
        System.out.println("\n****ROYAL BANK OF JAVA****");
        System.out.println("Are you here to get a mortgage? (yes or no)");
        //Task 1 - ﻿Pick up﻿ ﻿the user's decision.

```

## Task 2 - `if - else`

If the decision is `'yes'`, ask the user about their savings and debt. If the decision is anything other than 'yes', print: `'OK. Have a nice day!'`.

```
// -- Print this if the decision is "yes"
System.out.println("\nGreat! In one line" +
                   "\nHow much money do you have in your savings?" +
                   "\nAnd, how much do you owe in credit card debt?");
 
 
// -- Print this if the decision is not "yes"
System.out.println("\nOK. Have a nice day!");

```

Output for `yes`:

## Task 3 - Pick up the savings and debt values
--------------------------------------------

Pick up and store the savings and debt values.

```java
System.out.println("\nGreat! In one line" +
                   "\nHow much money do you have in your savings?" +
                   "\nAnd, how much do you owe in credit card debt?");
// Task 3 - Pick up each value        
```

## Task 5 - Pick up the user's name
Careful not to fall into the `nextLine()` trap.

## Task 6 - Logical Operator
-------------------------

Use a logical operator to check if the user has

-   **at least** $10,000 in their savings account.

-   **less than** $5,000 in credit card debt.

-   **more than** 2 years of work experience.

If they meet the requirements, print:

> `Congratulations <name>, you have been approved!`

Otherwise, print:

> `Sorry, you are not eligible for a mortgage.`

Finally, use these values:

-   `savings: 20000`

-   `debt: 1500`

-   `years: 7`
