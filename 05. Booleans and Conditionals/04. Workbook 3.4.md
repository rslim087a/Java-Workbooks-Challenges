## The Weather Network
-------------------

The workbook starts with a temperature (Celsius). There's also a `String` variable `forecast` that doesn't start with a value.

```java
public class WeatherNetwork {
 
 
     public static void main(String[] args) {
        int temp = 25;
        String forecast;
 
 
        System.out.println(forecast);
    }
}
```

## Task 1 - Update the forecast.
-----------------------------

Update the `forecast` variable based on the temperature.

-   Less than or equal to **-1**

> The forecast is FREEZING! Stay home!

-   Less than or equal to **10** 

> The forecast is Chilly. Wear a coat!

-   Otherwise

> It's warm. Go outside!

## Run your code.

### Test Case 1:
```java
    int temp = 25;
```
`>>: It's warm. Go outside!`

### Test Case 2:
```java
    int temp = -1;
```
`>>: The forecast is FREEZING! Stay home!`

### Test Case 3:
```java
    int temp = 0;
```
`>>: The forecast is Chilly. Wear a coat!`

### Test Case 4:
```java
    int temp = 10;
```
`>>: The forecast is Chilly. Wear a coat!`


### Test Case 5:
```java
    int temp = 11;
```
`>>: It's warm. Go outside!`


### Test Case 6:
```java
    int temp = -12;
```
`>>: The forecast is FREEZING! Stay home!`
