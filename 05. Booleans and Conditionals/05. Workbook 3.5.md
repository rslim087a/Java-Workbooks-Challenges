## Your Work Schedule
------------------

Assume that `day` can be any value between 1 (Monday) and 7 (Sunday). There's also a `boolean` variable: `holiday`.

```java
public class WorkSchedule {

     public static void main(String[] args) {
           int day = 3;
           boolean holiday = true;
     }
}

```

## Task 1 - Do I have work that day?
---------------------------------

In the event of a holiday, `print`:

> Woohoo, no work

During the weekend (Saturday or Sunday), `print`:

> It's the weekend, no work!

Otherwise, `print`:

> Wake up at 7:00 :(

## Run your code.
--------------

### Test Case 1:
```java
    int day = 3;
    boolean holiday = true;
```

`>>woohoo, no work!`

### Test Case 2:

```java
    int day = 3;
    boolean holiday = false;
```

`>>Wake up at 7:00 :(`

### Test Case 3:

```java
    int day = 6;
    boolean holiday = false;
```
`>>It's the weekend, no work!`
