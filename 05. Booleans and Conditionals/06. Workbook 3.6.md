## Your Calendar
-------------

The code starts with a `day` variable. Your friend wants to hang out on that day.

```java
public class Calendar {
 
 
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         String day = "Friday";
         System.out.println("Hey, are you free on " + day + "? \n");
 
 
         System.out.println("Hmm, let me check my calendar.");
 
 
    }
}
```

`>>Hey, are you free on friday?`

`>>`

`>>Hmm, let me check my calendar.`

## Task 1 - Check your calendar

Check that day against 7 days from your calendar.


- `case Monday`, `print`:

> Sorry, I have to stay at work late.

- `case Tuesday`, `print`:

> It looks like I have meetings all day.

- `case Wednesday`, `print`:

> I have a dentist appointment. Some other time!

- `case Thursday`, `print`:

> Sorry, thursday is date night!

- `case Friday`, `print`:

> I'm free!!

- `case Saturday`, `print`:

> I'm free!!

- `case Sunday`, `print`:

> I'm free!!

- `default`:

> That's not a day.
