From the `Java Bootcamp Resources`, launch **`Workbook 6.4`**.

## Task 1

Use `Scanner` to pick up the user's response. Store the response in a `String` variable.
```
>>: Welcome to Java Grocers.
>>: What can I help you find?
```

## Task 2
------

Using the `for` loop, check every element in the array. 

```java
   0          1         2          3          4        5
"apples", "bananas", "candy", "chocolate", "coffee", "tea"
```


If there is a match, break the loop and print the aisle (index) that they're looking for.

Aside from adding interactivity, the code should be identical to Workbook 6.3.
