Exams (Revisited)

Another wave of students needs to write their exams.

## Task 1

Create a new array of five students.

```java
"Malfoy", "Crabbe", "Goyle", "Pansy", "Dean"
```
## Task 2

Create a `for` loop that runs through the array, and prints a message for each element.

### Result

>>: Crabbe, you will take seat 1
>>: Goyle, you will take seat 2
>>: Pansy, you will take seat 3
>>: Dean, you will take seat 4
