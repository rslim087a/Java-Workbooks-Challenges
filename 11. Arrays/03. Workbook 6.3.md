## Task 1

Create an array that stores aisles.
```java
"apples", "bananas", "candy", "chocolate", "coffee", "tea"
```

## Task 2

A customer is looking for coffee.
```java
System.out.println("\nDo you sell coffee?");
```
 
Create a `for` loop that searches the array for the `coffee` aisle.

```java
   0          1         2          3          4        5
"apples", "bananas", "candy", "chocolate", "coffee", "tea"
```
Once you find the aisle (when your condition is `true`), display the following message:

```java
System.out.println("\nWe have that in aisle: <index>");
```
