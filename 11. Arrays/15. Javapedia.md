# Javapedia

Javapedia is a free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. As a world-renowned editor, your task is to submit information about famous historical figures.

Then, Javapedia will print the content from its "database" (in our case, a 2D array)

Javapedia also lets the user search popular figures by name:

```
**********Javapedia**********
How many historical figures will you register?

        Figure: 1
         - Name: Marco Polo
         - Date of birth: 08/01/1324
         - Occupation: Merchant

        Figure: 2
         - Name: Shakespeare
         - Date of birth: 26/03/1564
         - Occupation: Playwright

These are the values you stored:
        Marco Polo 08/01/1324 Merchant
        Shakespeare 26/03/1564 Playwright

Who do you want information on? Marco Polo

        Name: Marco Polo
        Date of birth: 08/01/1324
        Occupation: Merchant
```

-------------------

From `Java Bootcamp Resources` -> `Module 2` -> `6. Array`, open Javapedia.

Task 1
------

Ask the user: `How many historical figures will you register?`. Store the value in an `int` variable.

![](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2025-01-04_01-30-54-e9ae073a912a9701d32c659ea53486a9.png)

Task 2
------

Make a 2D array named: `database`. The data we're going to submit will take the form of a table.

![](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2025-01-04_01-30-54-ad3aa6397744c87bb76d543fbf9a1104.png)

So, our array must have as many rows as there are historical figures. Each row also needs 3 values.

**Don't populate the array yet. Leave that for task 3.**

Task 3
------

Create a `for` loop that runs through every row in the database. The user needs to submit three values per row.

![](https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2025-01-04_01-30-54-2015f053b4b9ee8c91930c4deb86f753.gif)

As the user submits each value, you need to store it in the appropriate row. While doing this task, be careful of the `nextLine` pitfall (see cheat sheet).

Task 4
------

Print the contents of `database`. Create a function called `print2DArray`.

```java
/**
 * Function name: print2DArray
 * @param array (String[][])
 *
 * Inside the function
 *  1. print the database
 *   - a tab of space precedes each row.
 *   - each value in database has one space from the other value.
 */
```

**Inside the function:**

-   add a tab of space before each row.

-   add a space after printing each value.

Once you finish writing the function, use it to print `database`:

Task 5
------

The final task is to let the user search the database by name. If the search matches a name in `database`, print that row's information.

**Final Output:**

```
**********Javapedia**********
How many historical figures will you register? 2
 
 
        Figure: 1
         - Name: Marco Polo
         - Date of birth: 08/01/1324
         - Occupation: Merchant
 
 
        Figure: 2
         - Name: Shakespeare
         - Date of birth: 26/03/1564
         - Occupation: Playwright
 
 
These are the values you stored:
        Marco Polo 08/01/1324 Merchant
        Shakespeare 26/03/1564 Playwright
 
 
Who do you want information on? Marco Polo
 
 
        Name: Marco Polo
        Date of birth: 08/01/1324
        Occupation: Merchant

```

When printing the information, add a tab of space before each line.

Good luck!
