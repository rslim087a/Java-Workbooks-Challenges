Open the challenge
------------------

From `Java Bootcamp Resources` -> `Module 1` -> `6. Array`, open `Challenge 6`.

## Task 1: Create an array
-----------------------

The Tic Tac Toe board is a grid with three rows.

Each row has three '`_`' characters. Your first task is to store these characters in an array.

## Task 2: Print the array
-----------------------

Write a function that prints the board. Call the function after creating the board.

```java
//Task 1: Create a board: char[][] board
//Task 2:  Call the function: printBoard(board);
```
```java
/**
 * Function name - printBoard()
 * @param board (char[][])
 *
 * Inside the function:
 *   1. print a new line.
 *   2. print the board.
 *    - separate each row by two lines.
 *    - each row precedes a tab of space
 *    - each character in the grid has one space from the other character
  */
```
Inside the function:

-  Print a new line.

-   add a tab of space before each row.
-   add a space after printing each character.
