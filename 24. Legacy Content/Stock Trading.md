# Stock Trading

The stock trading application will test your ability to apply concepts from module two. It will also challenge you to get creative and research.

Git Bash will successfully interpret the color codes used in this project.

**Instructions**
================

The instructions are not detailed because there are many ways to solve this challenge. It's up to you to come up with a plan of action.

## **a) Open the starter project**
-----------------------------------

![Screen Shot 2021-10-03 at 11.03.13 PM.png](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/learnthepart-75aed.appspot.com/o/images%2F4cd1caf9-6721-42c5-9bcb-f272f8604b27?alt=media&token=d88e7493-825a-4316-84dd-ae9d241bfbb4)
## **b) Inheritance**
-----------------------------------

From the requirements, identify the parent and children classes. 


## c) Test-Driven Development
----- 

> **Test-Driven Development:** Writing tests before writing code. 

Read the requirements before writing any of the following unit tests.

**Buy Tests:**

- Shares of a stock for a `Personal` account increase after purchase.
- Shares of a stock for a `TFSA` increase after purchase.
- No shares are added in the event of insufficient funds.
- Funds available in a `Personal` account decrease after purchase.
- Funds available in a `TFSA` decrease after purchase (must account for `TRADE_FEE`).

**Sell Tests:**

- Shares of a stock for a `Personal` account decrease after purchase.
- Shares of a stock for a `TFSA` decrease after purchase.
- No funds are added if shares being sold exceeds shares owned.
- Funds available in a `Personal` account increase after sale (must account for `SALE_FEE`).
- Funds available in a `TFSA` increase after sale (must account for `TRADE_FEE`).

## d) Aesthetics
----- 

Your children classes must inherit this `toString`.


```java
    public String toString() {
        return "\n  Stock\t\t"  + Color.RESET + "Shares" +
        "\n\n" + displayPortofolio() + Color.RESET +
        "\n  Funds Left\t" + Color.GREEN + "$" + round(this.getFunds()) + Color.RESET;
    }
```

## **e) Main**
-----------------------
Your `Main` class contains pre-defined methods. 

### **Part 1** 
First, call the method that explains the application to the user.

### **Part 2** 
After the user chooses an account, call the method that displays their initial balance.

### **Part 3** 
There are 2160 records in each CSV file. Create a loop that runs from 1 to 2160.


```java
        for (int day = 1; day <= 2160; day++) {
         
        }
```

During each run, display the prices (see **`part 4`** first). 

### **Part 4** 
You must learn to stream the elements of a CSV file. Inside `getPath()`, use the following code to return the **`Path`** of the CSV file.

`Path path = Paths.get(Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResource("src/main/data/"+stock+".csv").toURI());`

Catch the checked exception as needed.

### **Part 5** 
Complete the `getPrice()` method.

**Hints:**
- You can run through all lines as a stream of elements using: `Files.lines(path)`.

- You must skip the first element in each file (the column headers). You can skip an element in a stream using `.skip(element number)`.
- **Intermediate Operations**:
``` java
    .filter(filter value that matches day)
    .map(map to price value)
```
- **Terminal Operations**:
``` java
    .findFirst()
    .orElse(null)
```
### **Part 6** 
After displaying the prices, ask the user to
 - `buyOrSell()`
 - `chooseStock()`
 - `numShares()`

Then execute the `buy/sell` trade with your `Account` object.

### **Part 7** 
Call `tradeStatus()` to notify the user of a `"successful"` or `"unsuccessful"` trade.

## **f) Research**
----------------------- 
Don't be afraid to research! As a developer, it's important that you practice finding resources online. 

## **g) Run the finished application**
----------------------- 
Before you start coding, I encourage you to run the finished application and get familiar with the output.

## Good luck!
